# G.O.A.T.

The term "G.O.A.T." stands for "Greatest of All Time." This repository contains the Backend and Frontend code for a web application that allows me to save notable "greatest of all time" items across various categories, such as sports, music, movies, and more.

The application allows saving saving Moments that have meaning to me, like favorite songs, notable sports moments or funny video clips. This collection should serve as a kind of time capsule where moments can be revisited - olds songs can be listened to, significant sport moments can be rewatched. In short its a collection of GOAT things.

It should not only link to the item, but make a copy of the video/song/website so that its persisted even if that item is deleted from the internet.

# Technologies
